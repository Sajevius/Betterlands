# Betterlands
Making the badlands just a bit better!

### ABOUT
Betterlands is a Forge 1.16 (1.17 version coming soon), biome expansion mod that expands upon the much-abandoned badlands biome through a handful of features. Its aim is to make the biome (and all sub-biomes) an interesting place, and to provide some functional features that the player can use almost anywhere (mechanics, blocks, items, special armor, etc.)
This is the first ever mod of mine that I started to port to pure Java code. I'll be porting my other projects maybe after this one.

### ORIGIN
Originally, this mod was made with MCreator. I have to admit, it was decent... but it wasn't the best for sure, and it was being limited by MCreator's constraints. I felt like some things are missing, and that this mod's full potential should be allowed to flourish. And so recently, I the author have decided to port it to custom code: to test my capabilities (I'll be moving on from MCreator when working on my projects), make technical improvements, and make this better than ever before.
