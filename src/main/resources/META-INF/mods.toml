description='''
A mod that expands upon the torrid and desolate badlands biome, making it a bit livelier by adding a myriad of fun features!

Original mod made with MCreator. Thanks to learning Java and Forge I was finally able to port this mod, which garnered tons of downloads, into one with full, non-generated code.
I will always keep the MCreator version in my heart :,)
